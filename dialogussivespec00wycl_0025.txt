uselessness of Universities ¹ it is more pronounced, thus
indicating that some such interval as a year must have
elapsed between the two works. While, however, Ι thus
tentatively put forth the year 1379 as the probable
date of the Dialogus, I feel most strongly that until all
Wyclif’s works are in our hands no final decision is pos-
sible, and if I have treated the subject at some length
it has been much more with a view of furnishing to
riper scholars than myself the materials for considera-
tion than from a desire to force my own opinion on my
readers.

Of the ten extant manuscripts of the Dialogus nine
have been examined for this edition. The estimated
expense of collating the tenth, which is at Prague, was
unfortunately too great for the Wyclif Society to be
justified in incurring it. For the description of the eight
Vienna MSS, I am indebted to notes supplied by Dr.
Herzberg-Frankel, by whom the collations of the text
have been made. The manuscripts are as follows :—

1. Ashburnham xxvii. c. ff. 97-116 and 118—121.

On vellum, about 6} >< 4{‚ written legibly‚ but without
any attempt at adornment, in a charter hand of the
Fisteenth century. The copyist has gone through his
work and corrected it. The MS. has 121 leaves and
contains three English Tracts and eleven in Latin, in-
cluding a fly-sheet on the mystical sense of Castellum on
f. 117. The Dialogus occupies leaves 97—116‚ and
118-121. The last four leaves contain Chapters 29, a

¹ On this last point there is a most interesting progression traceable
between the language of the English version of the De Officio Pastoralz'
(Cap. 14), the Dialogus (Cap. 26), and the De Papa (Cap. 10), which alone
would go to prove that the Dialogus was written at the same tirne between
the other two.
