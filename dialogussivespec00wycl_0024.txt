XX INTRODUCTION.

subjecto, quod non fuit fides tempore augustini. (2) On
p. 54, ll. 17 sqq. Veritas, after speaking of scholastic
studies as fruitful of heresies, again takes as his example:
Ut qne securitas est ia istis defendendo quod hostia conse-
crata non sit corpus domini sed accidens incognitum sine
subjecto, ut reserant nove secte? (3) On p. 70, ll. 25 sqq.
he actually is already proposing that this question should
be made a test one, and that the priests ancl friars‚ on
pain of outlawry‚ shall declare regi et regno, ex efficaci
autoritate scripture vel racione, quid in natura saa sit
ipsa hostia consecrata. These passages make it clear that
at the time the Dialogus was written, Wyclif was already
in the final stage of his opinion on the subject of Tran-
substantiation, though the form in which they are cast
leaves it open to us to hold that he had not yet formu-
lated his doctrine with the precision with which it is
presented in the twelve theses. That he should have
promulgated those theses without any previous discus-
sion or warning appears antecedently improbable, and Mr.
Matthew, in the Introduction to his ‘Unprinted English
Works of Wyclif ' (pp. XX—Xxiv)‚ has already shown that
there is no yawning chasm between these theses and
Wyclif's teaching as early as 1367. The date which, in
that Introduction, Mr. Matthew assigned to Wyclif's first
public maintenance of his final view of the Eucharist is
1380, but I have his authority for saying that he now
considers it ‘ most probable that Wyclif‘s final views on
this subject were formed by 1379.'

Thus from an examination of its references to current
events, and of its place in the development in Wyclif's
doctrines, the Dialogus appears to have been written in
the course of the year 1379. This date is further con-
firmed by the strong resemblance which our treatise
bears to the De Papa which Mr. Matthew has assigned
to 1380. On every other point the language of the
De Papa is almost identical with that of the Dialogus,
but on the schism, the doctrine of the Eucharist and the
