INTRODUCTION. XV

the new Archbishop was inhabilis, though, according to
Wyclif's teaching, the pressure which his noble kinsmen
may have brought to bear may have made the appoint-
ment simoniacal 3 (2) that in the Latin tract De Doemonz'o
Meridiano, which, from its style and appearance of having
been written soon after the death of the Black Prince
(June 8, 1376) cannot, Ι think, be placed later than early
in 1377, there is an equally distinct reference to the
opposition to faithful preachers. If this be so, Wyclif’s
‘Poor Priests' must have both begun their work, and
met with resistance much earlier than is supposed, and
the reference in our text may be to some previous per-
secution of them1.

Our next date-passage is a probable reference to the
death of Gregory XI in March, 1378. In Chapter
24 Mendacium had thrown out the taunt, Qualiter-
cnnqne liic loquaris in angulis non anderes ista defen-
dere vel dicere cerani papa, and Veritas had answered
him, Confisus in fide audeo liec dicere coram deo. Et si
mortem temporalem adlmc timeo, sicut petrns, repnte qnod
debeo istam sentenciam defendere corani papa. In Chapter
29 Mendacium launches a more distinct threat in the
words ista defendens citaberis, excommnnicaberis, et ab
omni frnctn in ecclesia utili suspenderis, to which Veritas
makes answer‚ St antichristus citat lionzinenz ad locum
quem non intelligit, nec scit si pro tempore citationis erit
in tartaris cuni diabole stabilitus, et Christus citat per

¹ As this view is somewhat different to that held by the editor of the
treatise‚ Dr. Buddensieg, it is only right to quote his Presace. ‘ To judge
from the whole tone of the Tract, it must have been written shortly after
the death of the Black Prince, who died June 8, 1377 (sic). The style also
suits this date very well . . . I would defend this date more keenly‚ unless
in the last chapter the opposition between the rich clergy, who try to hinder
the free preaching of the Gospel by the itinerant preachers, were so
strongly marked; for according to all particulars hitherto known of the
institute of Wyelif's itinerary preachers, an earlier date than the year 1382
would not suit this antagonism. The date, therefore, must remain un-
certain.’ The passage referred to runs: sacerdos fidelis volens gratis pre-
dicare evangelium sesa cristi erit statim prohibitus predicare. It is to
be noted that Dr. Buddensieg here postdates the death of the Black Prince
by a year, though it is given correctly in the note on p. 418.
