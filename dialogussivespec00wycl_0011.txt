case against endowments as stated from Scripture, and
in 11-23 we have the defence of Veritas to successive
appeals by Mendacium to Church authority. Worsted
on the theory of the question, Mendacium then falls
back on the practical difficulties in the way of dis-
endowment, and the consideration of these occupies
Chapters 24—33. Finally in 34-36 Veritas briefly shows
the part which each order of the Church has to play,
traces the history of endowment, and points out the
advantages to be gained by its abolition. In the Epi-
logus, which is scholastic in form, new arguments are
added, with a recapitulation of some of the most im-
portant points previously made.

As an introduction to his arguments, Veritas briefly
describes the division of the Church Militant into the
three orders of Clerus, Domini Temporales, and VulgareS,
and explains their several functions and relations. In
three successive chapters the proof from the Old Testa-
ment is then unfolded, which here, as in the very early
English tract lee Clergy may not lzold Propero), and the
very late Supplementmn Trz'alogzg is mainly based on the
three texts, Numbers xviii. 20, Deuteronomy xviii. 1,
and Ezekiel xliii. 28. In the following two chapters it
is shown that this teaching is confirmed by that of
Christ, and also of Solomon‚ Peter and Paul.

In Chapter 8 Mendacium makes his first reply. It is
true, he says, that Christ preached poverty‚ but He did
not intend it to be a permanent law. The glory of the
priesthood requires the support of endowments3 these
are held in the name of Christ as ⁶ patrimonium crucifixi,'
and are sanctioned by the concessions of temporal lords
and the approbation of the Pope. Is Christ’s law to
pass away, Antichrist’s to endure? Veritas answers. The
so-called ‘glory' of the priesthood is their shame; to
say that they hold their estates in the name of Christ is
a blasphemous attempt to shift their sin upon Him.
Christ is the ‘ dominus capitalis‚’ without whose consent
