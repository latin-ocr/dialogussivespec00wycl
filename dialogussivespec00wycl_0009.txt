OF Wyclif ’s Dialogus, or Speculum E eclesie spsilz'lantz's,
no less than ten manuscripts have corne down to uS, a
greater number than of any other of his works. Of
these ten manuscripts nine are in public libraries at
Vienna and ngue, and for the most part bear plain
traces that they were transcribed by Bohemian copyists.
¹The only English manuscript extant is that in the collec-
tion of Lord Ashburnham, and from this, by the owner's
kindness, the text of the present edition has been taken.
Though Wyclif's immense influence in Bohemia is now
well known, that the foreign transcripts in existence
should outnumber the English by nine to one is at first
sight startling. It is probably to be explained by the
popular character of the Dialogus, especially in its early
Chapters, as compared with other of Wyclif's Latin
works. In England this would not greatly increase its
'circulation, as nearly the whole of the work can be
paralleled from the English writings. But in any foreign
country it would naturally widen the circle of readers,
and the use which Dr. Loserth has made of the Dialogus,
in proving the debt of Hus to Wyclif, helps to show
'that the large number of the Bohemian transcripts in
existence is not merely the result of accidentl.

As the name by which it is generally known informs

¹ The Dialogus and T rz'alogus are mentioned together as the two books
on which in 1408 bachelors were forbidden to hold public lectures in
Bohemia, and in the list of writings of Wyelif condemned in 1410 the
Dialogus eomes first. (Losertlss ‘Wyclis and Hus,’ Eng. Ed.‚ pages 105
and 115).
