INTRODUCTION. XXV

serapt so good that I felt justified in printing it exactly
as it stands, with the exception that in some three or
four places letters which had accidentally been omitted
have been inserted within brackets. On the other
hand where the text has been taken {rom 1387 Ι
have sometimes felt obliged to adopt the reading os
one of the collated MSS. and relegate that of 1387
to a note.

As to the collations, in order to enable readers to see
for themselves the exact value of the three manuscripts,
for Chapters 1—7 Ι have printed every varIation, however
minute, except of course mere differences of spelling. As,
however, the printing of petty variations has the effect
of obscuring important 01165, from Chapter 8 onward
Ι 113ν6 rejected such as seemed utterly worthless. But I
believe that I have given, without exception, every varia-
tion in which the three collated manuscripts agreed and,
with very sew exceptions, all of those which are given
by any two of them.

It remains to refer briefly to the question of the place
of Chapters 31 and 32, and generally of the arrangement
of the latter part of our treatise. Chapter 31 is found
only in the Ashburnham manuscript, the chapter num-
bered in the text 32 only in that and in three out of
the eight Vienna MSS. The place of this latter chapter,
where it does occur, is sufficiently singular, for in the
Vienna MSS. it eomes between Chapter 36 and the
Epilogus, from which it does not appear to be in any way
marked off. In the Ashburnham MS. Ι for a long time
persuaded myself that the second digit was so faint
that it might be a 2. I have now, however, no doubt
that it is really a 7. Thus in this manuscript also the
chapter appears as a kind of appendix. The justification
for assigning it a place between our Chapters 31 and 33
lies in the fact that both in the Ashburnham MS. and
in 1387 3 place for a chapter is vacant, and that there
appears no other way os filling it in the Ashburnham.
